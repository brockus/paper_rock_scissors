## About

Welcome to an exciting game of paper rock scissors. This game features
a battle between player and computer and weapons for the player to choose.

## Setup and Compile
------------------------------------------------

Firstly the users should set up a project build directory before
compiling, this can be done with the following:

```console
meson setup <<builddir-name>>
```

The compile command builds a default or a specified target of a
configured Meson project, this can be done with the following:

```console
meson compile -C <<builddir name>>
```

To run the game for one time just use `prs`.
The number of games can be extended to a specified number of loops
by using the `--num-games` switch as follows to run this five times:

```console
prs --num-games 5
```
